/**
 * SimPawn - GEAS 2013, Alex Strout
 * This was originally intended to provide any functionality that might be needed for a
 * non-spectating Unreal client (which we don't use) or the AUV "driver" pawn
 * However, UDKPawn provides everything we need - none-the-less, this class is here for
 * consistency and to provide easy space to extend the "driver" pawn or non-spectating
 * Unreal client (should that ever be used)
